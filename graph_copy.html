		<h2>Part 1: DAOST Chapter 2 Questions</h2>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				Explain in your own words the point of the jitter plot.
			</div>
			<div>
				A jitter plot is a special scatter plot. Jittering stand for a specific procedure where the aim is to prevent overlapping
				in statistical graphics. Overlapping can occur when the data is not continuous and only specific values can be interpreted
				or when a continuous measurement is rounded to the nearest value. Jittering is achieved by adding a random noise to the
				data and thus shifting them a bit away from their original locations. To improve the visual experience it is recommended
				to represent datapoints with an empty circle instead of a dot, thus helping the eye to distinguish the ones who are close
				to each other.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words" going forward, but I hope
				you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).
			</div>
			<div>
				Plotting data with histograms results in information loss, due to the binning process applied in histogram creation. This
				information loss is displayed on the figure mentioned in the question. The plots are representing the same dataset, the
				only difference is the number of bins used in the histogram. Choosing the proper binning has a huge effect on the resulting
				diagram. It is recommended to try a few binning solutions before settling for the final one.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And I don't. I didn't give a
				detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage. I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby
				create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading?
			</div>
			<div>
				KDE stands for Kernel Density Estimation, an alternative solution to histograms. The problems one can face when using histograms
				are that they are not smooth, they depend on end points of bins and they depend on the width of bins. The first two problems
				can be solved by using KDEs. Rather than fixing the end points of the blocks we center each of the data blocks at each
				data point. With a very fine "blocking" procedure, and by placing blocks on top of each other when there is an overlap
				we can obtain the density estimate. But at this step our graph is still "blocky". To solve this we should use a smooth
				Gaussian curve instead of the block when there is a datapoint. Selecting the proper bandwidth of the Gaussian curve is
				a very important step, with a small standard deviation the final graph we obtain will be "undersmoothed", but applying
				a big standard deviation will result in an "oversmoothed" graph. As a drawback of KDE it is important to mention that
				it is hard to see where the actual data is. In some cases it is better to see the data position directly.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than
				histograms of KDEs". What does he mean by that?
			</div>
			<div>
				Cumulative Distribution Function is more or less the integral of the histogram. This graph at point 'x' tells us what fraction
				of data can be fount to the 'left' of x. This type of diagram has a lot of essential advantages. Reading of important
				key values such as minimum, median, quantil or maximum can be easily done directly from the plot. Detection of outlier
				data can be also done from this plot. Besides these advantages mentioned previously, this type of data visualization
				has drawbacks too. The problem is that the eye is much better at judging distances than areas and CDF uses aereas to
				represent datapoints.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				What is a
				<i>Quantile plot</i>? What is it good for?
			</div>
			<div>
				A quantile plot is obtained from a CDF plot by switching the x-y axes. The information contained in this graph is the same
				as it was in the CDF but the main reason behind this type of graphs is the better data representation. For example if
				we have data about a country's population, and lets say we want to investigate the wealthyness of households, and the
				dispersion of it, CDF is a good way to go. With the help of this graph we can easily answer questions like "What yearly
				income corresponds to the 20th percentile of the country's population?".
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				How is a
				<i>Probability plot</i> defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?
			</div>
			<div>
				The probability plot is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a data set follows a given distribution such as
				the normal distribution. The data are plotted against a hypothetical distribution in such a way that the points should
				form approximately a straight line. Distances from this strait line corresponds to departures from the specified distribution.
				The slope of the line is σ (standard deviation of normal distribution) and the zero intercept is μ (mean of the distribution).
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain
				why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better.
			</div>
			<div>
				These summary statistics apply only under certain assumptions and are misleading or even can be wrong if those assumptions
				are not met. Mean, median, and other related summary statistics are only valid when the distributions has a single, central
				peak, on other words, the distribution is unimodal. If this basic assumption is not fulfilled, then conclusions based
				on simple summary statistics will be wrong. Even worse, nothing will tip you off that they are wrong: the numbers will
				look quite reasonable. For example an outstanding data which may result from an error in the data registration can easily
				ruin the average. Let's take an example, a group in preschool where there are 10 child with 1 year and 1 who's 5 years
				old. Describing this dataset with summary statistic can result in uninterpretable data.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?
			</div>
			<div>
				The box plot (or whiskers diagram) is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on the five summary
				statistics parameter mentioned before: minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum. Box plots provide
				an easy way to work with a huge data and to determine outliers in data. It is particularly useful for quickly summarizing
				and comparing different sets of results from different experiments.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="card">
			<div class="question">
				<i class="material-icons">help</i>
				The book doesn't mention
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot" target="_blank">violin</a> plots. Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?
			</div>
			<div>
				At a first glance, according to our personal opinion they are harder to interpret compared to a simple box plot. The plot
				itself is similar to a box plot, but instead of using straight lines in each side of the boxes, it uses a rotated kerner
				density plot. Thus they're providing more information about the dataset, especially about the probability density.

				out September is the month with the most unique types of fresh produce- forty three to be exact.</p>
